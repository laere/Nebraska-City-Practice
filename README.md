**ALL RIGHTS RESERVED TO NEBRASKA CITY, NEBRASKA**

This is a re-creation of the Nebraska city website. 

I solely did this for practice, and to better learn HTML/CSS

I believe this so far has taught me a lot more than some of my smaller work.

I learned more about dealing with tons of divs, and multiple page containers

and just general layout format, and working with relative units a lot more.

It's nowhere near being finished, but has come a very long way!
